# Movie Review Application

Welcome to the Movie Review Application! This project is a backend part that allows users to review movies. The application is built using MongoDB for the database, Java with Spring Boot for the backend, and React for the frontend. The architecture of the application emphasizes a separation of concerns, allowing the client and server code to evolve independently.

## Features

- **MongoDB Database:** The application uses MongoDB as its database to store movie information and user reviews.

- **Java with Spring Boot Backend:** The backend of the application is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. It handles the business logic, interacts with the database, and serves as the API for the frontend.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have MongoDB installed locally or have a MongoDB instance accessible.

### Running the Application

1. **Backend:**
   
   - Open the project in your favorite IDE.
   - Configure the MongoDB connection in the application properties file.
   - Run the Spring Boot application.
